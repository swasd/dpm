# dpm
A Package Manager for Container Engines

`dpm` is a package manager for container engines.
Currently it focuses on supporting Docker and soon for `containerd` as well as Kubernetes.

Started as a sub-project of `Swasd` (reads Swasdee - means Hello in the Thai language),
`dpm` stands for "Dee Package Manager". *Dee* is a Thai word literally means good.
Basically, we have a vision to have a good package manager for the clound native world.

The technology behind `dpm` is historically from a toy project named `gattai`.

## Getting Started

For example, to start a Consul discovery service (provision a machine and start a Consul instance) 
you can just do:

`$ dpm install consul-discovery`
